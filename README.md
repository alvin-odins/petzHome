- Problem
small pet store can hold only two breeds of dogs, e.g german sherpard and terrier, however it operates as follows, 
when people come to adopt a dog, they can only adopt the oldest dog of either breed, based on the time the dog was taken. 
or they can select if they want a german sherpard or a terrier, and will receive the oldest from either breed.

- Task
approach is to use the following:
1. enqueu
2. dequeuAny
3. dequeueGermanShep
4. dequeueTerrier
5. linked list

To solve the above problem set. I am working towards defining the problem exactly and to improve the solution as well.
